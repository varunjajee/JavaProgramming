/*
 * Polymorphism:
 *      Overriding / Dynamic binding in java
  *                 - is a example of run-time polymorphism
 *                  - It is the change in implementation of the methods
 *
 *                  - Dynamic (run time) polymorphism is the polymorphism existed at run-time.
 *                  Here, Java compiler does not understand which method is called at compilation
  *                  time. Only JVM decides which method is called at run-time.
