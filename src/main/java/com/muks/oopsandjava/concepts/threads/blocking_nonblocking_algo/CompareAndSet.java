/**

 *
 * In computer science, compare-and-swap (CAS) is an atomic instruction used in multithreading to achieve
 * synchronization. It compares the contents of a memory location to a given value and, only if they are the same,
 * modifies the contents of that memory location to a given new value. This is done as a single atomic operation. The
 * atomicity guarantees that the new value is calculated based on up-to-date information; if the value had been
 * updated by another thread in the meantime, the write would fail. The result of the operation must indicate whether
 * it performed the substitution; this can be done either with a simple boolean response (this variant is often
 * called compare-and-set), or by returning the value read from the memory location (not the value written to it).
