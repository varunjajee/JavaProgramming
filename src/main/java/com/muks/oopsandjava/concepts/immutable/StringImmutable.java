/*  Immutable simply means unmodifiable or unchangeable
    - String is designed to be immutable for the sake of efficiency and security.
    - This is also the reason why immutable classes are preferred in javageneraleg

    - Strings are thread safe "as every new string variable gets a new memory in string pool
    unless their values are same".

    - If the String is referring to same string value, then a reference is picked as below
