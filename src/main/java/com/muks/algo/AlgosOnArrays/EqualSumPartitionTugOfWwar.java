/* Given a set of n integers, divide the set in two subsets of n/2 sizes each 
 * such that the difference of the sum of two subsets is as minimum as possible. 
 * If n is even, then sizes of two subsets must be strictly n/2 and if n is odd, 
 * then size of one subset must be (n-1)/2 and size of other subset must be (n+1)/2.
 * 
 * 
 * The sum of two parts should be equal. 
 * That means sum should be equal to half of total sum. 
 * As they are all integers so if the sum is odd number then it is not possible to partition. 
 * If they are even we will try to find whether that half of sum is possible by adding numbers from the array. 
 * 
 * We solve this by dynamic programming. 
 * We take a two dimensional array L of size count+1, sum/2+1. 
 * Where L[i,j] = maximum sum possible with elements of array 0 to i and sum not exceeding j. 
 * We compute this array from L[0,0] to L[n,sum/2]. So for computing L[i,j] we need to check the element i. 
 * if it is greater than j then it cannot be included in the sum so L[i,j]=L[i-1,j]. 
 * If ith element is less than j, then we should consider two cases and take the greater of them. 
 * First case is where we don't include the element in sum. Then L[i,j] = L[i-1,j] which is exactly like before. 
 * Now if we include the element, then L[i,j]=a[i]+L[i-1,j-a[i]]. In this way we fill this 2-d array. 
 * If L[n,sum/2] is equal to sum/2 that means the array can be partitioned in two parts whose sums are equal. 
 * Then we find out which elements have been included in that sum by backtracking through that 2-d array.
 * 
 * For backtracking through the array we just apply the reverse logic. 
 * If L[i,j] is equal to a[i]+L[i-1,j-a[i]] then that element is included in the partition. 
 * Then we continue this process to L[i-1,j-a[i]). 
 * If it is not equal then the element is not included in the final sum, so we proceed to L[i-1,j] After we get the complete 
 * list of elements in a partition we remove them from the original array to get the second partition.
