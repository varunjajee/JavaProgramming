/*
 * 1. Find the K'th largest element in a binary tree
 * 2. In place sort of 2 arrays	
 * 3. swap two nodes of linked list (should work for all cases like 0,1,2 nodes)
 * 		3a) color based sort of linked list
 * 		say every node of a linked list has a new field color RED or BLACK -> move 
 * 		all black elements to end
 * 		
 * 		4b) do the same for 3 colored list (move red to front, black to the back so that the middle will contain the 
 * 		third element)
 * 4. Greedy search algorithm
 * 5. WAP to find the max of three numbers
 * 6. There is long list of natural numbers.
 * 		Remove every 2nd no from list in 1st pass
 * 		Remove every 3rd no from list in 2nd pass
 * 		Now find whether nth natural no will exist after p passes.. n and p are inputs
