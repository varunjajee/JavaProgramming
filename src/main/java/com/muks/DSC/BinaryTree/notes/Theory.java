        DFS - Depth first search. Examples are, in-order, pre and post order traversal.
            - TreeNode traversals as above are DFS since they go till the depht of the tree
            - DFS uses stacks

        BFS - Breadth first search. Used to print a tree in the level wise.
        The most natural solution for level-order traversal is Breadth First Search (BFS), since it
        visits the nodes level by level. BFS requires the use of a name structure called Queue,
        which is a First In First Out (FIFO) structure. If you are curious, level-order traversal
        can be implemented using DFS too. See my next post: Binary TreeNode Level-Order Traversal
        Using Depth First Search (DFS) for the challenge.
