	 * Ordered dictionary:

	 * In addition to the dictionary funcitonality:
	 * 
	 * 	We want to support following operations;
	 * 	1. min()
	 * 	2. max()
	 * 	3. Predecessor(dictionary S, key k)
	 * 	4. Successor(dictionary S, key k)
	 * 
	 *  => for this we required there must be a total order in the key
	 * 
	 * 
	 * List based Implementation
	 * 
	 * 	1. Un-Ordered list
	 * 			search takes O(n)
	 * 			insertion takes O(1)
	 * 
	 * 	2. Ordered list
	 * 			seach takes O(n)
	 * 			insertion takes O(n)
