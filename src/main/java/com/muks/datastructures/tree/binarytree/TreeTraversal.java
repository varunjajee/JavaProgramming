	 * 
	 * Tree walk/traversal is a way of visiting all the nodes in a tree in a specified order
	 * 
	 * Pre-order: processes each node before processing its children
	 * 
	 * Post-order: processes nodes after processing its child nodes.
	 * 
	 * In-order: where we visit node-n between left child and right child.
	 * 			Eg: visit left child, then node-n and then right child
	 * 
	 * Euler tour traversal: Walk around the tree and visit each node three times.
	 * 			Onto left, from bottom and onto the right
	 * 			When passing from left of a node, print the left bracket nodes and when
	 * 			passing from right, then print the right bracket nodes.
	 * 
	 * There is no notion of inorder traversal for a "generic tree" as this tree has nodes > 2
