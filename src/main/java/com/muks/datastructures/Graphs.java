	 * NOTE:
	 * -----
	 * Graphs are of 2 types:
	 * 	1. Directed graphs and 
	 * 	2. Un-directed graphs
	 * 
	 * Terminologies:
	 * 	1. Vertices and
	 *  2. Edges
	 *  	G=(V,E) => V - vertices of the graph, and E - set of edges of the graph
	 *  3. Adjacent vertices = 2 vertices which are connected by their edges are adjacent vertices
	 *  4. Degree of the vetices = no. of edges of the vertices,. Edge is the connecting link/line to the adjacent vertices.
	 *  5. Sum of the degree of vertices = 2 x the no. of edges.
	 *  6. Paths
	 *  	(i) Simple path
	 *  	(ii) cycle path or cycle
	 *
